This is a playbook for deploying Eucalyptus via packages in a distributed setup per the reference architecture found here:

http://www.eucalyptus.com/eucalyptus-cloud/reference-architectures/dev-test-large  (minus SAN).

It assumes you have an ansible inventory file which looks like this:

[clc]
<myclcip>

[walrus]
<mywalrusip>

[cc]
<myclusterip>

[sc]
<mystorageip>

[nc]
<mync1>
<mync2>
